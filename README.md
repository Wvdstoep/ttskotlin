Android Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
Follow-up of Android Demo: FastSpeech2 and Multi-Band MelGAN Integration

This project is a follow-up of a simple Android demo which loads converted FastSpeech2 and Multi-Band MelGAN modules to synthesize audio. In order to optimize the synthesis speed, two LinkedBlockingQueues have been implemented.
